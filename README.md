# Mobile Weather App iOS

This repository contains a complete and thoroughly designed weather app for ios in swift with UIKit with MVVM

I explored the OpenWeatherMap API and did sketches and Hi-FI Prototype on how the final product should be and the steps taken to achieve the task goals. I made 1 user flow.

I split into functional non-functional and out of scope
## Functional
- Fetch current location weather & Weekly Forecast with the use of CoreLocation Library
- Search for a city and get current weather Details
- Show Cities Location On map
- Save Cities to the favorites list using CoreData

## Non-Functional
- Offline Support through saved Data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Optimal bandwidth & CPU/Battery usage
- Dark & Light Mode Capabilities


## Out of scope
- Weather Alerts(Notifications)
- Widget Support
- Apple Watch Extended Functionality 
- Analytics
